            <h2>Hamilton County Minority Health Fair</h2>

            <p>In 2002, Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. partnered together in conjunction with the 28th Community Develop Corporation to focus on men’s health issues by providing a free health fair – Hamilton County Minority Health Fair.  The primary focus was geared toward prostate exams, blood pressure and other educational services for men.  In 2004, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. joined this partnership and added a focus on women’s and children’s health.   Since inception, thousands of people have received FREE health screenings and education.  Our motto is “Educate and Empower Minorities to Close the Gap.”</p>
